# News-Bias-Detection
News Bias Detection is an NLP-based web application that analyzes news content to determine political bias. Built with Streamlit and Hugging Face’s RoBERTa model, it classifies text into Left, Right, or Center categories. Users can either paste a URL or enter custom text, and the app performs real-time inference and displays results instantly.
